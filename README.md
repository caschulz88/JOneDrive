# JOneDrive
Java cross-platform implementation of the Microsoft OneDrive API

## Status
This project is at some very early state of development and is not available for production usage yet. I will try to push things forward in the next days and weeks to have a working library that can be used by everybody.

## Examples
If you are interested in a project that already uses JOneDrive library to have more examples on how to use this library please checkout the PanBox project, which is a GPL licensed software for securing cloud storage. I've been working quite a long time on that software already and wanted to include OneDrive support as well. That was the main reason for me implementing this library since there is currently no working Java library, which implemens the Microsoft OneDrive API and supports Desktop Java and Android.
